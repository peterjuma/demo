This topic describes how to configure the `max degree of parallelism` server configuration option in SQL Server by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[Azure Data Studio](../../includes/name-sos-short.md)], or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. When an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] runs on a computer that has more than one microprocessor or CPU, the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] detects whether parallelism can be used. The degree of parallelism sets the number of processors employed to run a single statement, for each parallel plan execution. You can use the `max degree of parallelism` option to limit the number of processors to use in parallel plan execution. For more detail on the limit set by `max degree of parallelism` (MAXDOP), see the [Considerations](#considerations) section in this page. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] considers parallel execution plans for queries, data definition language (DDL) operations, parallel inserts, online alter column, parallel stats collection, and static and keyset-driven cursor population.
